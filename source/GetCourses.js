This course will introduce you to the logic behind this designation, through a careful and critical examination of the theory and research on children's mass media use, and the influence of media on children.  We will explore the relationship between media use and developmental issues, discuss patterns of children's media consumption, and look at both the content and context of children's media, including television, films/videos, advertising, games and websites.  We will examine the empirical evidence that has attempted to assess the media's effects on children in a variety of areas, including gender and ethnic stereotyping, explicitly sexual and violent content in both entertainment and news, and also the educational or \"pro-social\" effects of media.  We'll talk about the wall-to-wall advertising to which children are exposed, and look at the claims that advertising and media use have led to an increase in childhood obesity.  And we will discuss the technologically saturated world of iPods, iPads, e-books, cell phones and computers that enable communication and social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, to see what kinds of effects these technologies might be having on children at different developmental points.  \r\nWe will also critically assess the various regulations that have governed both advertising and programming for children in this country, talk about contemporary regulatory issues and how changes in media ownership rules might affect children's media content.  We'll also discuss how technology such as TiVo, the television ratings system, voluntary Internet ratings system and access to the Internet affect children, pay some attention to the hot issue of cyberbullying, and will discuss the roles that parent and citizen activist groups play as watchdogs of children's media and the ways in which they can - and do - apply political pressure that results in change. \r\nFor each topic we cover, we'll be looking both at the theoretical issues that undergird them, and also at the empirical ones that have attempted to assess, test or analyze them.\r\nThe centerpiece of the class, however, will be your own work.  You will have an opportunity to develop a proposal for a significant piece of research in an area of children and media that most interests you.  It's my hope that this is research that you will subsequently carry out and ultimately publish, either as part of your MA or PhD program, or as a piece of applied research.",

Students consider and evaluate models of matter that describe and explain phenomena such as diffusion, compression, and thermal expansion at the microscopic level. The practice strand introduces a model of investigation. Students analyze their experiences in the course and use four video cases (Grades 2, 4, 5, and 8) to make their understanding of inquiry more explicit.

They use computer software to explore and explain thermal phenomena using the particulate theory of matter that depends on thinking of matter as composed of microscopic atoms and molecules. The practice strand addresses formative assessment, that is, classroom assessments that inform instruction. In their study of assessment participants: (a) develop skills for eliciting and interpreting scientific ideas held by students; (b) become familiar with research about children's science ideas; and (c) consider possible strategies to encourage further development of students' scientific understanding. During the course participants maintain a log documenting the evolution of their practices in the clinical setting and of their understanding of assessment for learning.

Participants work with scientific models, maps, satellite images, and quantitative data. In hands-on investigations, they use physical models, light probes, temperature probes and spectroscopes to investigate light and its interaction with matter. Building on work with assessment from the previous course, participants come to understand formative assessment as an integral part of the teaching-learning process that takes place at each stage of scientific inquiry.

Fuzzy control logic (FCL) has been implemented into many consumer products and complex systems, e.g., the control of camera exposures, elevators, high-speed trains, and helicopters. Genetic algorithms (GAs) are computer-based routines modeled after the mechanisms of natural selection and inheritance that control biological evolution. These routines are very useful for finding good solutions to what are often complex problems. GAs find application in areas such as artificial intelligence as well as in traditional engineering areas, such as system design and parameter estimation.

There has been an explosion of information over the past two decades on the health benefits of exercise. In addition, exercise and nutrition are closely linked, with each modifying the effects of the other. Athletes, for example, may have markedly increased needs for some nutrients, but not others. Exercise has potent effects on the metabolism of protein, energy, fat, and some micronutrients. In addition, exercise is an important form of oxidative stress, and the ability of nutrients to alter the effect of exercise is not well understood. Exercise and nutrition together offer an extremely powerful intervention for a variety of problems, including the frailty of aging, the wasting of AIDS, and the obesity that underlies most cases of diabetes and atherosclerosis. This course is designed to give students an understanding of the fundamental interactions between exercise and nutrition, and to offer students an opportunity to examine the application of nutrition to exercise and vice versa. Each lecture will also discuss how these factors are important in disease prevention, and where applicable, treatment.",

We will consider the ethical implications that are inherent in the choice between justice and mercy, freedom and order and truth and loyalty. Students will analyze the moral and ethical underpinnings of ideas that promote new approaches to development and humanitarian action with a personal, academic and institutional perspective. Even as the world is coming closer together in the information age, divisions on the lines of regional, ethnic and religious identities continue to grow more pronounced and stark. This course will encourage students to articulate their personal beliefs and ethical values. As students move to become policy makers and stakeholders it is essential that they are grounded in an understanding of their own moral framework and also appreciate the differences that exist in their midst.

We also address methods for solving the most frequently encountered data problems, such as multicollinearity, complex survey design, and outliers. Most methods are drawn from the field of econometrics, but they are chosen for their likely usefulness for social science research more generally.

Consequently, the Internship Course has three goals or learning outcomes: (1) to maximize the students' learning during their time in the field,\r\n(2) to increase the students' ability to articulate what they have learned, and (3) to increase the students' awareness of the learning process itself.",

We will explore painting, drawing, sculpture, installation and other disciplines and media with an eye toward investigating unique ways of making art. Abstraction, Realism and Conceptual approaches will be addressed and explored through a variety of hands-on projects. Individual and collaborative exercises will challenge students to broaden their awareness of personal and assimilated beliefs, conceptual ideas and autobiographical content through the use of metaphor, symbol and unconventional media. Class discussions, readings, presentations and field trips will supplement studio practice and look at art making in context of historical, cultural and contemporary issues. The interactive, participatory nature of Art as Process enables students coming from diverse areas of study to expand and enrich their perspectives of the broader community. Open to all, from absolute beginners to advanced artists, Art as Process is particularly useful for those interested in exploring and developing their own creative abilities, assembling a portfolio or exploring the idea of a professional art career.",

After our exploration with clay we will use various media: cardboard, wood, plaster, glued constructions, wire, found objects, and recycled material. Students have also used materials as diverse as jell-o, balloons, newspaper, moss, water, and dirt to create sculptures.  This class is about developing your personal vision, exploring your imagination in three dimensions, and responding to your intuition.  You will also see the importance of honing your choice of materials to most successfully express your ideas.  Sculpture, once defined as objects in space, now exists in an expanding field of invention and intervention, including technology and performance. Films, videos, websites, and readings on a variety of topics from art and performance to neuroscience will augment the class experience.",

      "course": "FAMB142",
      "descr": "The portrait is a subject that has endured throughout the history of art and is essential to virtually every form of fine art, from painting and sculpture to video and photography. Portraiture is specific and general, timely and timeless. It tells us about a particular individual while revealing something about us all. Portrait drawing involves technical, organizational, spiritual, and philosophical concerns basic to any work of art. The initial objective is to produce a physical resemblance to the model, but it is even more important to progress toward the elusive \"other\" inner life (sometimes at the expense of physical likeness). Although this workshop focuses on drawing, we will explore several approaches to portraiture using materials such as charcoal, graphite, acrylics, ink washes, and water-based paint.

The MacIntosh computer and screen-printing, laser toner, and decals will be utilized to transfer to clay your working images as drawings, paintings, video stills, photographs, or computer generations. We will develop suitable clay bodies, glaze palettes, and firing strategies, as well as construction, modeling, and carving techniques. Knowledge of basic photography, video, computer, screen-printing, or ceramics will be helpful, but not required. Ultimately, this class will enter unknown territory-the intersection of electronic media and clay as a durable vehicle for wall art, sculpture, vessel, functional container, mural or installation.
